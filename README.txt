Time spent: 8.0 hours

I used the A3 Solution.

For coloring the grid, I chose to color... 
the selected species red,

the closest relative orange,

closely related species yellow,
(closely related meaning species whose distances were j where j satisfied this condition:
distance of closest relative < j < (maximum distance from selected species)/2)

distantly related species green,
(distanty related meaning speices whose distances were k where k satisifed this condition:
k > (maximum distance from selected species)/2)

An extra feature I added was a color key.

Overall the assignment was not too bad.
I would say that I learned more about GUIs from the Breakout assignment from Intro to Computing with Python
but the assignment itself was pretty cool. I learned more about JLabels, Boxes, and the class Color.
